# Description

## A mod that allows you to filter which status effects are shown on your screen. Highly recommend using the Configuration Manager to configure this mod easier.

Made at the request of [TangoFrags](https://www.twitch.tv/tangofrags) on Twitch.

Should be compatible with all mods that add status effects and modify the status effect system.

`Client Only, no need to be on the server.`

     Special thanks to RedSeiko for some of the code in this mod.
     You'll find most of their code I used in the ConfigManagerEntry folder of my codebase.
     I felt their version was a bit overly complex so it's modified a bit to be more "out-of-the-box" BepInEx configurations.
     I have also added some features and caching that weren't really present before.
